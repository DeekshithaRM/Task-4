# ðŸ§  Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

This repository contains code for binary classification using *Logistic Regression* on the *Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset*. The model predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various diagnostic features.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
- Build a binary classifier using logistic regression.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and classification report.
- Visualize the sigmoid function and ROC curve.
- Understand threshold tuning and its effect on classification performance.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- *Source*: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset.
- *Target variable*: diagnosis â€” M (Malignant = 1), B (Benign = 0)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Steps Implemented
1. Load and clean the dataset (data.csv)
2. Drop unnecessary columns (id, Unnamed: 32)
3. Encode labels (M â†’ 1, B â†’ 0)
4. Handle missing values
5. Train-test split (80/20)
6. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
7. Train a logistic regression model
8. Predict and evaluate:
   - Confusion Matrix (with heatmap)
   - Classification Report
   - ROC-AUC Score
9. Visualize:
   - ROC Curve
   - Sigmoid Function

---

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics
- *Confusion Matrix*
- *Precision, Recall, F1-Score*
- *ROC-AUC Score*

---

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations Included
- ROC Curve  
- Sigmoid Function  
- Confusion Matrix (Heatmap)
